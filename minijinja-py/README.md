# minijinja-py

This is an experimental binding of MiniJinja to Python.  It has very limited functionality
and it's unclear if this project has any future or value.

These bindings use [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/) and [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/).

To build and run the unit-tests in a on-demand virtual environment use

```
$ make
```
